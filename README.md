# IrpMonitor

## Overview
**IrpMonitor** is a Windows mini-filter kernel driver and user-mode application designed to help developers understand **I/O Request Packets (IRPs)** and their parameters. This tool is particularly useful for beginners in Windows kernel driver development, as it provides insights into how IRPs are generated and handled by the system.

## Features
- **User-Mode Application:** Performs different file operations to trigger IRPs (as shown in the screenshots).
- **Mini-Filter Kernel Driver:** Intercepts IRPs generated by the user-mode application, analyzes them, and prints their types and parameters.
- **Educational Purpose:** Helps developers gain a deeper understanding of Windows kernel internals and how IRPs work.

## Motivation
Understanding IRPs and their various types is essential for any Windows kernel driver developer. This project aims to provide a hands-on approach to learning by allowing developers to observe IRPs in real-time as they are triggered by user-mode operations.

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
- Windows operating system
- Windows Driver Kit (WDK) installed
- Admin privileges to install and manage drivers

### Building the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OmarShehata11/IrpMonitor.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio with the WDK installed.
3. Build both the **mini-filter driver** and the **user-mode application**.

### Running the Driver
1. Install the INF file of the driver
3. Start the driver:
   ```bash
   sc start IrpMonitor
   ```

### Running the User-Mode Application
1. Open a command prompt as Administrator.
2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   C:\path\to\IrpMonitorHelper.exe
   ```
3. Perform different file operations in the user-mode application and observe the IRP logs printed by the driver.

### Uninstalling the Driver
1. Stop the driver:
   ```bash
   sc stop IrpMonitor
   ```
2. Delete the driver service:
   ```bash
   sc delete IrpMonitor
   ```

## Future Plans
In future updates, I plan to add more types of file operations performed by the user-mode application, providing a deeper understanding of how different user actions translate to IRPs at the kernel level.

## Disclaimer
Use this tool at your own risk. Modifying system-level file access can have unintended consequences. Ensure you understand how kernel drivers work before deploying them on a critical system.
